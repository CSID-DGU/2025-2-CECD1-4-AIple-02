This is a classification task -- choose an appropriate area from the area options for a task at hand.

Classification Task: !<INPUT 8>! is !<INPUT 10>! as a part of !<INPUT 9>!. Pick one of the choices given in the Area options that !<INPUT 11>! should go to.

!<INPUT 3>! is currently in {!<INPUT 4>!} that has ONLY !<INPUT 5>!. !<INPUT 6>!

Follow these rules strictly, in this order:

1. If the description of the current action or sub-action (the text "!<INPUT 9>!" or "!<INPUT 10>!") explicitly contains the exact name of one of the areas listed in the Area Options (for example, "Hobbs Cafe"), you MUST choose exactly that area as the answer.
2. Otherwise, stay in the current area if the activity can be done there.
3. Only go out to a different area if the activity clearly needs to happen there.

Stay in the current area if the activity can be done there. Only go out if the activity needs to take place in another place.

Area Options Available (Class label): {!<INPUT 7>!}

Answer with exactly one area name, copied verbatim from the Area Options, and nothing else.
